# My Portfolio 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Welcome to my portfolio! You can access it here: https://lnkd.in/dJXY-crB

## Technologies Used
This portfolio was built using React on the client-side. For sending emails, I used EmailJS, a service that allows sending emails directly from the client-side. The styling was done using CSS files, with no templates or component libraries used.

## Deployment
The project is deployed using Netlify, a free service that makes it easy to deploy web applications. To deploy the project, all you need to do is upload the build version of the project.

Thank you for checking out my portfolio!
